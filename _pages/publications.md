### [Impact of High School Graduation Requirements on Health of High School Students](https://github.com/kanekarsanket/kanekarsanket.github.io/raw/master/files/PolicyImpactOnBMI.pdf) (Job Market Paper)

In this study, I evaluate the relationship between high school students' rigorous coursework and their health behaviors, such as body mass index (BMI), smoking cigarettes, alcohol consumption, and TV viewing. I consider the state increase in high school students' math graduation requirements as a measure of their rigorous coursework. I use the state survey data from Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance System from 1993 to 2019 and employ the difference in difference method in this study. The results suggest that states with higher math requirements for graduation are likely to have a lower BMI and obesity prevalence. The BMI decreases by 0.12 units at a 5% significance value, and the probability of being obese decreases by 1.3 percentage points at a 1% significance value. The results by race suggest that BMI and obesity level decreases for white students with a significant value, while no significant change was observed for minority students (black and Hispanic). Additionally, white high school students are less likely to smoke a cigarette and watch TV, while no such impact was observed for minority students. Furthermore, there is an increase in current drinking behavior among white high school students. Overall, the results suggest that rigorous math coursework does positively impact the health of high school students.
