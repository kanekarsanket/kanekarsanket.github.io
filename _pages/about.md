I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the Auburn University. My primary research interests are in the areas of health economics, public health, and public policy. I am particularly interested in applying empirical econometric methods to answer questions about the efficacy of various policies and programs.

I will be on the academic job market this year, and I’ll be available for interviews at the AEA 2023. You can reach me at ssk0012@auburn.edu.
